To use the document translator, you would:

1. Save the entire Python code I provided into a file (let's call it `translator.py`)
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install transformers langchain python-docx openai
   ```
3. Set your OpenAI API key as an environment variable:
   ```
   export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here  # on Linux/Mac
   # or
   set OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here  # on Windows
   ```
4. Make sure you have a Word document named 'sample.docx' in the same directory as your script
5. Run the script:
   ```
   python translator.py
   ```

The script already includes this example in the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block:

```python
# Example: Translate a document to German
result = process_user_request("Please translate the document 'sample.docx' to German and save it as a new file.")
print(result)
```

When you run the script, it will:
1. Load the document 'sample.docx'
2. Translate its content to German (the default target language)
3. Save the translated document as 'sample_de.docx' in the same directory
4. Print the result of the operation

If you want to modify the behavior or translate different documents, you can edit the example commands in the main block of the script before running it.

Is there a specific aspect of using the translator that you'd like me to clarify further?
